Semaphore: It prevents multiple processes or threads from accessing data from shared resources, such as critical sections, etc.
(At least one sync destination)
Mutex: Preventing one Process or Thread from accessing data from shared resources or critical sections.
(One sync destination)

Mutex perfomance time is faster than Semaphore perfomance time
